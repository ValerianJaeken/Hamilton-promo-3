## The BeCode rules

1. Read the [livret de l'apprenant (French only for now)](./Livret-apprenant(e)s.pdf).

### Your presence is required.
- If you ever must set up an appointment, we strongly recommend you schedule it on **Tuesday mornign** (be back at BeCode 13h25).
- If you have to be somewhere or if you are ill, **you must warn us at least a day in advance by an email** to {PROMO_COACH1_EMAIL}  AND {PROMO_COACH2_EMAIL} . We will add it to the startup agenda so that everyone knows you're not available for them at that moment.

### **Justifications are mandatory.**

Whenever you are not at BeCode whilst you are supposed to, you mustshow us a legal written justification : medical certificates when you are sick, on the day of your return.

## Teaching material

- [Tutorials](/Tutorials) : These tutorials were designed to be done alone. They mix theory with practice, so as to help you grow quickly and reach a level where we can leave you to continue learning by doing on your own. They are created by your coaches. Never hesitate to follow them several times. Repetition is key.
- [Projects & exercices](/Projects) : these projects were designed to explore well-known coding challenges and learn by doing. You'll find plenty of help online and among your teammates.
- [Missions](/Missions) : external projects coming from real clients.
